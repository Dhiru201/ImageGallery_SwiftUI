# Note:- 

I have completed this assignment to the best of my ability within the given timeframe. However, there may be some cases in development or testing that I may have overlooked. I apologize for any shortcomings.

Additionally, the URL provided for data fetching includes images, but the image server has been intermittently unavailable, resulting in occasional timeout or "server not found" errors.

Aside from that, I have completed the assignment. If there is anything that needs further discussion, please feel free to reach out. I used SwiftUI for development to enhance my skills in that area.


# Conclusion

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
